# Program
Our target is to cover maximum papers in the following domain within 12 months and then keep on repeating the cycle. Participants are themseleves the organizers.
* Weekly 1 Sesssion (60-90 min) + 1 Session (with invited speaker and 90-120 min) every fortnight = 6 Sessions Monthly
* Via 12*6=72 Sessions, i.e., 8 Sessions for each track we will cover the most
* Timings: **TBD**
* Venue: Offline: Multimedia Lab, Block-II, EE Dept., IIT Delhi, Online: 
* Our first session kicks-off on **31st August'23**
