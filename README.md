# Tracks 
We have sub-divivded the field under exclusive and exhaustive 9 tracks.

* Track 1: **Humans: Face, Body, Pose, Actions, Gestures, Emotions**
* Track 2: **Generative AI: NeRF, Diffusion, Graphics, LLMs**
* Track 3: **Architectures: Transformers, GNNs, Scalable and Efficient Vision, Convolutions**
* Track 4: **Theoretical ML: Theoretics, Convergence, Optimization, Generalization, NTKs, Expressivity**
* Track 5: **Adversarial Learning: GANs, Adversarial Attacks, Adversarial Robustness, Adaptaion**
* Track 6: **Responsible AI: Fairness, Bias, Ethics, Transparency, AI Safety**
* Track 7: **Learning Paradigms: Few-Shot, Open-Set, Zero-Shot, Semi-Supervised, Long-Tailed, Multi-Task**
* Track 8: **Multi-Modal: Sensors and Modalities**
* Track 9: **Applications: Medical Informatics, Biometrics, Remote Sensing etc**

# Program
Our target is to cover maximum papers in the following domain within 12 months and then keep on repeating the cycle. Participants are themseleves the organizers.
* Weekly 1 Sesssion (60-90 min) + 1 Session (with invited speaker and 90-120 min) every fortnight = 6 Sessions Monthly
* Via 12*6=72 Sessions, i.e., 8 Sessions for each track we will cover the most
* Timings: **TBD**
* Venue: Offline: Multimedia Lab, Block-II, EE Dept., IIT Delhi, Online: 
* Our first session kicks-off on **31st August'23**

# Guidelines
* Any member can lead a track or host a session. Multiple members can do the same jointly.
* **If leading a track**. Reponsibilities:
    * Cover those papers/sub-topics which exhaustively cover the track
    * Suggest/Invite speakers for the same
* **If hosting a session**. Responsibilities:
     * Concisive but Exhaustive session
     * Having slides for presentation is a plus but not mandatory
     * Booking a slot 1 week prior
* We expect a member to have adequate exposure to the deep-learning, hence we will do initial screening based on your profile.
