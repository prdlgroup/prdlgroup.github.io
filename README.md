* Track 4: **Theoretical ML: Theoretics, Convergence, Optimization, Generalization, NTKs, Expressivity**
* Track 5: **Adversarial Learning: GANs, Adversarial Attacks, Adversarial Robustness, Adaptaion**
* Track 6: **Responsible AI: Fairness, Bias, Ethics, Transparency, AI Safety**
* Track 7: **Learning Paradigms: Few-Shot, Open-Set, Zero-Shot, Semi-Supervised, Long-Tailed, Multi-Task**
* Track 8: **Multi-Modal: Sensors and Modalities**
* Track 9: **Applications: Medical Informatics, Biometrics, Remote Sensing etc**

Some of the eagerly planned papers:
1. [Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3503250)
2. [Low-Resource Adaptation for Personalized Co-Speech Gesture Generation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Ahuja_Low-Resource_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Co-Speech_Gesture_Generation_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)
3. [A Closer Look at Smoothness in Domain Adversarial Training](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/rangwani22a/rangwani22a.pdf)
4. [Disentangling Writer and Character Styles for Handwriting Generation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Dai_Disentangling_Writer_and_Character_Styles_for_Handwriting_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)

# Program
Our target is to cover maximum papers in the following domain within 12 months and then keep on repeating the cycle. Participants are themseleves the organizers.
* Weekly 1 Sesssion (60-90 min) = 4 Sessions Monthly
* Via 12*4=48 Sessions, i.e., 5-6 Sessions for each track we will cover the most
* Timings: **TBD**
* Venue: Offline: Multimedia Lab, Block-II, EE Dept., IIT Delhi, Online: **TBD** 
* Our first session kicks-off on **31st August'23**

# Guidelines
* Any member can lead a track or host a session. Multiple members can do the same jointly.
* **If leading a track**. Reponsibilities:
    * Cover those papers/sub-topics which exhaustively cover the track
    * Suggest/Invite speakers for the same
* **If hosting a session**. Responsibilities:
     * Concisive but Exhaustive session
     * Having slides for presentation is a plus but not mandatory
     * Booking a slot 1 week prior
* We expect a member to have adequate exposure to the deep-learning, hence we will do initial screening based on your profile.
